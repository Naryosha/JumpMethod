# JumpsMethod
*UPD: 19 Feb 2017*

This repository contains an attempt to replicate some of the results that were achieved in

    Sugar, C. A., & James, G. M. (2003). Finding the number of clusters in a dataset: An information-theoretic approach. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 98(463), 750–763. JOUR.d

In particular, it is attempted to replicate the results that are illustrated in Figure 4.

Another reason why this repository was created is that the implementation of the Jump Method algorithm on Python cannot be found pretty easily on the internet.
